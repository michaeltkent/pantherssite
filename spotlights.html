    <p id="luke-spotlight">
        Luke Kuechly, known as "Captain America" to Panthers fans, is a legendary figure in Carolina Panthers history. A
        first-round draft pick in 2012, Kuechly wasted no time making his mark on the NFL, earning Defensive Rookie of
        the Year honors in his debut season. His unparalleled instincts, football IQ, and sideline-to-sideline dominance
        quickly established him as one of the premier linebackers in the league.

        Throughout his career, Kuechly's leadership and playmaking ability were instrumental in the Panthers' success,
        earning him numerous accolades including seven Pro Bowl selections and five First-Team All-Pro honors. His
        crowning achievement came in 2013 when he was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year after recording a
        league-leading 153 tackles, four interceptions, and two touchdowns.
