    <h2>Featured Player of the Week: Luke Kuechly</h2>

    <p>
        Luke Kuechly, known as "Captain America" to Panthers fans, is a legendary figure in Carolina Panthers history. A
        first-round draft pick in 2012, Kuechly wasted no time making his mark on the NFL, earning Defensive Rookie of
        the Year honors in his debut season. His unparalleled instincts, football IQ, and sideline-to-sideline dominance
        quickly established him as one of the premier linebackers in the league.

        Throughout his career, Kuechly's leadership and playmaking ability were instrumental in the Panthers' success,
        earning him numerous accolades including seven Pro Bowl selections and five First-Team All-Pro honors. His
        crowning achievement came in 2013 when he was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year after recording a
        league-leading 153 tackles, four interceptions, and two touchdowns.

        Off the field, Kuechly's humility, work ethic, and dedication to the community endeared him to fans and
        teammates alike. His charitable endeavors, including his involvement with the "Kuechly's Crew" program,
        showcased his commitment to making a positive impact beyond the game.

        Despite retiring prematurely in 2020 due to concerns over concussions, Kuechly's legacy as one of the greatest
        Panthers of all time remains firmly intact. His contributions to the franchise and the game of football will be
        celebrated for years to come, serving as an inspiration to future generations of Panthers players and fans
        alike.
