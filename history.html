            <p class="trivia-ps">
                The Carolina Panthers officially entered the NFL as an expansion team, bringing professional football to
                the
                Carolinas for the first time. Backed by ownership led by Jerry Richardson, a former NFL player himself,
                the
                Panthers quickly captured the hearts of fans with their inaugural season. Led by head coach Dom Capers,
                the
                team finished with an impressive 7-9 record, setting the stage for future success. This historic moment
                marked the beginning of a journey filled with thrilling victories, memorable players, and enduring
                traditions for Panthers faithful.

            <h2 class="trivia-h2s">Super Bowl Run of 2003: </h2>

            <p class="trivia-ps">
                One of the most unforgettable chapters in Carolina Panthers history came during the 2003 NFL season.
                Under
                the guidance of head coach John Fox and powered by a formidable defense nicknamed the "Cardiac Cats,"
                the
                Panthers embarked on an extraordinary postseason journey. Led by quarterback Jake Delhomme and a stellar
                cast of players including Julius Peppers and Steve Smith, the Panthers blazed through the playoffs,
                culminating in a showdown against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Although the Panthers
                fell
                short in a closely contested game, their remarkable run to the championship game remains etched in the
                annals of Panthers lore as a testament to the team's resilience and determination.

            <h2 class="trivia-h2s">Cam Newton's MVP Season:</h2>

            <p class="trivia-ps">
                In 2015, quarterback Cam Newton electrified the NFL with a sensational MVP campaign that propelled the
                Carolina Panthers to unprecedented success. Newton's dynamic playmaking ability, both through the air
                and on
                the ground, captivated fans and pundits alike as he led the Panthers to a franchise-best 15-1
                regular-season
                record. Alongside a dominant defense spearheaded by linebacker Luke Kuechly, the Panthers stormed
                through
                the playoffs, earning a trip to Super Bowl 50. Although they ultimately fell short against the Denver
                Broncos, Newton's MVP season stands as a crowning achievement in Panthers history, symbolizing a golden
                era
                of excellence and excitement for the team and its loyal supporters.
