            Greg Olsen, affectionately known as "Greg the Leg," left an enduring legacy during his tenure with the

            productive tight ends in the NFL. His sure hands, route-running prowess, and knack for making clutch catches
            endeared him to Panthers fans and earned him widespread respect across the league. Olsen's remarkable
            consistency was exemplified by his three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons from 2014 to 2016, a feat

            folklore. Despite facing doubts about his size and speed, Smith defied the odds and emerged as one of the
            most dynamic and fearless wide receivers in the league. Known for his tenacity, competitive fire, and
            penchant for making acrobatic catches, Smith became a nightmare for opposing defenses and a fan favorite in
            Carolina. His iconic performances, including his dominant showing in the 2003 playoffs and his
            record-setting 2005 season, solidified his place as one of the greatest players in Panthers history. Beyond
            his on-field exploits, Smith's impact extended off the field through his charitable work and community
            engagement, earning him admiration and respect both on and off the gridiron. While his time with the
            Panthers eventually came to an end, Smith's legacy as a Panther transcends statistics, embodying the spirit
